# Getting Started

This topic explains how to set up a development environment and write a minimal example for all our supported programming languages/platforms.

## iOS {#ios}

The [Dronecode-SDK-Swift](http://dronecode-sdk-swift.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/master/index.html) reference contains everything needed for iOS development of Dronecode SDK apps.

> **Tip** The Dronecode-SDK-Swift is in alpha development. 
  We plan to make our first official (beta) release in the coming weeks.


## C++

This [Guide](../guide/README.md) explains how to write *Dronecode SDK* apps using C++. 
A simple complete example can be found in [Takeoff and Land](../examples/takeoff_and_land.md).

> **Note** At time of writing all users will need to [build the library](../contributing/build.md) in order to use it. 
  In the near future we'll have binary releases for the wrapper APIs.
