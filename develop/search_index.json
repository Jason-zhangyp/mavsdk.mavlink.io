(develop)\n  \n\n\nThe MAVSDK is a MAVLink Library with APIs for C++, iOS, Python and Android.\n\n The SDK is the best way to integrate with a flight stack over MAVLink!\n  It is supported by Dronecode, ensuring that it is robust, well tested, and maintained.\n\nThe library provides a simple API for managing one or more vehicles, providing programmatic access to vehicle information and telemetry, and control over missions, movement and other operations.\nThe library can run on a vehicle-based companion computer or on a ground-based GCS or mobile device (these devices have significantly more processing power that an ordinary flight controller, enabling tasks like computer vision, obstacle avoidance, and route planning).\nDevelopers can extend the core C++ SDK using plugins in order to add any other required MAVLink API (for example, to integrate a flight controller with custom cameras, gimbals, or other hardware over MAVLink).\nCross-platform wrappers for the core library are actively being developed.\nThese (primarily) use gRPC and Reactive Extensions.\nProject Status\nThe MAVSDK is a robust and well-tested library that is already being used in production environments.\n\n Future compatibility is not guaranteed (the API is not \"stable\").\n\nThe current status is:\n\nC++ core library (2016). Used in production.\nMAVSDK-Swift (2018): Used in production.\nMAVSDK-Python (2019): Used in production.\nMAVSDK-Java (2019): Beta.\nMAVSDK-JavaScript (2019): Proof of concept.\nMAVSDK-CSharp (2019). Proof of concept.\nMAVSDK-Rust (2019): Proof of concept.\nOther cross-platform wrappers are actively being developed.\n\nGetting Started\n\nPython 3 developers install and use MAVSDK-Python from PyPi (pip3 install mavsdk). \nThere is no further setup, so you can then immediately run the examples in the normal way. \nThe drone API is essentially the same as for the C++ API.\niOS developers should start from the Dronecode-SDK-Swift reference.\nC++ Developers should start at the C++ Library.\n\nGetting Help\nThis guide contains information and examples showing how to use the SDK.\nIf you have specific questions that are not answered by the documentation, these can be raised on:\n\nDiscuss board\nSlack (#mavsdk) (get a Slack login here)\n\nUse Github for bug reports/enhancement requests:\n\nC++ API\nC++ Documentation\nSwift API and Docs\n\n\nLibrary Features\nThe core library is written in C++, with auto-generated bindings for other supported programming languages.\nThe library is:\n\nStraightforward and easy to use. It has an API that supports both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous calls (using callbacks). \nFast, robust, and lightweight. Built to handle onboard usage with high rate messaging.\nCross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android).\nExtensible, using compile-time plugins.\n\nThe main features provided by the core API are (in all programing languages):\n\nConnect to and manage up to 255 vehicles via a TCP, UDP or serial connection.\nGet information about vehicles (vendor, software versions, product versions etc.)\nGet vehicle telemetry and state information (e.g. battery, GPS, RC connection, flight mode etc.) and set telemetry update rates.\nSend commands to arm, disarm, kill, takeoff, land and return to launch.\nCreate and manage missions.\nControl a camera and gimbal both inside and outside of missions.\nSend commands to directly control vehicle movement.\nSend commands to start sensor calibration.\n\nSee the FAQ for answers to common questions about the library. \nContributing\nWe welcome contributions! If you want to help or have suggestions/bug reports please get in touch with the development team. \nThe Contributing (C++) section contains everything you need to contribute, including topics about building the SDK from source code, running our integration and unit tests, and all other aspects of core development. \nLicense\n\nThe MAVSDK is licensed under the permissive BSD 3-clause.\nThis documentation is licensed under CC BY 4.0 license.\n\nGovernance\nThe MAVSDK project is hosted under the governance of the Dronecode Foundation.\n\n\n \n\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

A vehicle is referred to a system in this SDK.\nA system needs to have a specific MAVLink system ID but can consist of multiple components with different component IDs. \nAn example would be a drone with a gimbal and a camera talking MAVLink with the same system ID but different component IDs.\nThe limit is in theory 255 vehicles for system IDs ranging from 1 to 255.\nIs MAVLink 1 supported?\nNo. The SDK only supports MAVLink 2.0.\nWhat sorts of vehicles are supported?\nThe SDK API is designed for interacting with aircraft. It has primarily been tested for use with multicopters, but also has basic support for fixed wing and VTOL.\nThe API may \"work\" with ground-based or other types of vehicles, but some methods will not make sense. \nThis use-case is unsupported and untested.\nDoes the SDK support indoor use?\nIndoor use is not supported (at time of writing).\nThe SDK requires that connected vehicles have a position estimate. \nCurrently this means that GPS is required. \nIn future we also expect PX4 to support local positioning methods (optical flow or visual-inertial odometry), \nat which point indoor use will also become possible.\nWhat UAV flight stacks are supported?\nThe SDK is optimised for use with the PX4 flight stack and all testing is done against PX4.\nWhile many features should work on other flight stacks there may be implementation differences at the MAVLink microservices level that mean not every API will work. \nFor example, PX4 and ArduPilot implement the parameter protocol differently, and use different modes for accepting commands from a companion computer.\n\n The SDK welcomes contributions to better support flight stacks other than PX4.\nWe do however expect contributors to also help with testing and maintenance support for using the SDK with their autopilot.\n\nAre serial connections supported?\nYes. Serial, TCP, and UDP connections are supported.\nWhy is libCURL a dependency?\nlibCURL will be required to download the camera definition file which is referenced in CAMERA_INFORMATION. \nIt might also come in handy whenever any other REST resources are required. \nHow are plugins added?\nPlugins need to have the correct structure and be placed in the plugins directory. It is also possible to create SDK Extensions that contain plugins outside of the SDK tree.\nCan a plugin depend on another one?\nYes - but it should not! \nThe idea is that plugins don't have any coupling between each other which allows for any plugin to be changed or removed without breaking the rest. \nThis will lead to some duplication at places, that's an acceptable trade-off. \nIf the same code is used in many places, it can always be moved to core and get re-used from there.\nWhat is the difference between unit and integration tests?\nThe unit tests are only concerned with one plugin or less. \nThe integration tests however might need PX4 SITL running and combine multiple plugins.\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

Instead, methods that can fail return success or an error reason as enum values.\n\n The error code usually reflects acknowledgment from the vehicle that it will perform the requested action (or not). \n  The operation itself may not yet have completed (e.g. taking off).\n\nThe various classes also all provide methods getting human readable strings from their associated enum (e.g. connection_result_str(), Telemetry::result_str()). You can see how these are used in the example code.\nShared Vehicle Control\nA vehicle can receive commands from multiple sources, including a Ground Control Station, or other MAVLink applications.\nSDK applications, which are running in environments where it is possible, can explicitly monitor for changes in flight mode \n(outside application control) and change behaviour appropriately (e.g. using Telemetry::flight_mode_async()). \nAPI Limitations/Behaviour\nSupported Vehicles\nThe SDK has been designed to manage aircraft that use the PX4 autopilot. \nIt has primarily been tested for use with multicopters, but also has basic support for fixed wing and VTOL.\nThe APIs include methods that do not make sense for other vehicle types - including \"takeoff\" and \"land\". \nWhile ground vehicles may work, they are not supported and are untested.\nSimilarly, other autopilots may well work, but, they are not explicitly supported and are untested.\nTelemetry/Information\nThe SDK gets and stores vehicle state/telemetry information from received MAVLink messages. \nThe information is supplied to callback subscribers as soon as message updates are received. \nClients can also query the API synchronously, and will get the information from the last received message (depending on channel latency, this information will become increasingly \"stale\" between messages).\nThe rate at which update messages are sent by the vehicle can be specified using the API (but will be limited by the bandwidth of the channel). \nDevelopers need to use a channel and a message update rate that allows their desired control algorithm to be effective - there is no point trying to use computer vision over an unreliable high-latency link.\nInfo information does not change for a particular vehicle, so will be accurate whenever read.\nActions/Offboard\nAction methods (and any other \"vehicle instructions\") return when the vehicle has confirmed that the message was received and will be acted on (or not). \nThe methods do not wait for the commanded action to complete.\nSo, for example, the Action::land() method returns as soon as the vehicle confirms it will land, but will actually land at some later point. \nThe implication is that developers will need to separately monitor the completion of the requested actions, if this is important to the application.\nMissions\nThe Mission and MissionItem APIs provide a the most useful subset of MAVLink mission commands as a developer-friendly API. \nNot every mission command behaviour supported by the protocol and PX4 will be supported by the SDK. \nFor example, at time of writing the API does not allow you to specify commands that jump back to previous mission items.\nThe API allows you to download/import missions. \nNote however that this will fail if the mission contains a command that is not supported by the API.\nConnection Status\nA system is considered to be disconnected (timed-out) if its heartbeat message is not detected within 3 seconds.\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

This is the normal/most common way for offboard APIs to connect to PX4 over WiFi.\n\nThe SDK also provides the connection_result_str() method, which you can use to create a human-readable string for the ConnectionResult.\nThe code fragment below shows how you might print the string for the preceding code fragment to the console:\nstd::cout \nRegister for System-Detection Notifications\nThe SDK monitors any added communication ports for new systems, which are distinguished by vehicle UUID. \nClients can register for notification when new systems are discovered using register_on_discover(), and for systems timing out (no longer connected) using register_on_timeout().\nThe methods are used in the same way, and invoke a callback function with the UUID of the system that was discovered/disconnected. \nThis UUID can then be used to get a System object for managing the associated vehicle (see Accessing Systems below).\n\n If a system does not have a UUID then Mavsdk will instead use its MAVLink system ID (a number in the range of 1 to 255).\n  On a properly configured MAVLink network this will be unique.\n\nThe code fragment below shows how to register a callback (in this case the callback is a lambda function that just prints the UUID value to standard cout).\nMavsdk dc;\n... //add ports\ndc.register_on_discover([](uint64_t uuid) {\n    std::cout \nIterating all Systems\nYou can iterate all system UUIDs that have been detected by Mavsdk \n(since it was started, over all communication ports) using the system_uuids() method. \nThis returns a vector of UUID values, from which you can get System objects that are used to manage vehicles.\nThe following code fragment shows how to iterate through the UUIDs (in this case, just printing them to standard cout).\n//Iterate through detected systems\nstd::vector system_vector = dc.system_uuids();\nfor ( auto i = system_vector.begin(); i != system_vector.end(); i++ ) {\n    std::cout \nThe vector contains UUIDs for all systems detected by Mavsdk, including those that may no longer be connected. \nYou can use Mavsdk::is_connected(uint64_t) to determine if the system with a particular UUID is connected or not.\nIf you're only expecting a single connection, then you can use the parameterless is_connected() method.\nAccessing Systems\nOnce Mavsdk has provided you with a vehicle UUID you can use the Mavsdk::system() method to get its associated System object:\nMavsdk dc;\n//... \n//Use UUID named uuid to get the associated System\nSystem &system = dc.system(uuid);\n\n\n If you know that there is only one connected system you can instead call system() without any UUID. \n  This will return the first system detected, or a null System if none have been discovered.\nSystem &system = dc.system()\n\nThe System is used by the MAVSDK plugin classes to query and control the vehicle. \nFor more information see Using Plugins (and the other guide topics).\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

The default update rate depends on the autopilot and may also be limited by the characteristics of the communications channel. You can set the rate for each type of telemetry, and both synchronous or asynchronous rate-setting methods are provided. \n\n For PX4 running on hardware the default rates are set on a per-mode basis in mavlink_main.cpp (search on configure_stream). For PX4 running on SITL, the default rates are defined in the init file.\n\nThe rate-setting methods are all used in the same way, so we just show one example for both the asynchronous and synchronous methods below. In both cases we set the rate for position updates.\nTo set the position update rate synchronously (in this case using set_rate_position()):\n// Set position update rate to 1 Hz.\nconst Telemetry::Result set_rate_result = telemetry->set_rate_position(1.0);\nif (set_rate_result != Telemetry::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    // handle rate-setting failure (in this case print error)\n    std::cout \nTo set the position update rate asynchronously with set_rate_position_async() (here we use a promise to block until we have a result):\n{\n    std::cout >();\n    auto future_result = prom->get_future();\n    // Set position update rate to 1 Hz.\n    telemetry->set_rate_position_async(1.0, [prom](Telemetry::Result result) {\n        prom->set_value(result); //fulfill promise\n    });\n\n    //Block until promise is fulfilled (in callback function)\n    const Telemetry::Result result = future_result.get();\n    if (result != Telemetry::Result::SUCCESS) {\n        // handle rate-setting failure (in this case print error)\n        std::cout \nGetting Regular Updates\nThe best way to get telemetry updates is to use the asynchronous methods. \nThese methods are non-blocking - they take a callback function argument and return immediately. \nThe callback will be invoked with a populated struct of the associated type as soon as an update message arrives from the vehicle. \nThe rate at which this occurs can be set through the API as discussed above. \nFor example, the Telemetry::position_async() has the following prototype, where position_callback_t is called with a populated Position:\nvoid mavsdk::Telemetry::position_async(position_callback_t callback)\n\nThe code fragment below shows this method being use with a lambda function for the callback, which simply prints out the current position and altitude).\ntelemetry->position_async([](Telemetry::Position position) {\n    std::cout \nDetecting Changes (only)\nThe asynchronous callbacks are updated every time new information is provided by the vehicle. \nFor some types of telemetry you may only wish to report only when the value changes.\nThe example below shows how to use flight_mode_async() to report only when the current flight mode changes. \nThe example uses a lambda function callback that captures a variable for the last mode. \nThis variable is compared to the current flight mode to determine whether the value has changed and needs to be reported.\n// Set up callback to monitor flight mode 'changes' \nTelemetry::FlightMode oldFlightMode=Telemetry::FlightMode::UNKNOWN;\ntelemetry->flight_mode_async([&oldFlightMode](Telemetry::FlightMode flightMode) {\n    if (oldFlightMode != flightMode) {\n        //Flight mode changed. Print!\n        std::cout \nThis same approach can be used to report only messages that meet some condition.\n\n In future we may add a mechanism in the API to support just reporting changes: Issue #63.\n\nBlocking Telemetry Requests (State Management)\nSome commands/vehicle operations must be performed in a certain sequence, or can only be called when the vehicle reaches a certain state. \nFor example, in order to takeoff the vehicle must first be armed, and in order to arm, the vehicle must have a home position/GPS lock. \nFor these cases you will want to monitor for the vehicle being in a certain state and block other commands until it is ready to proceed. \nOften the easiest approach is to use synchronous methods and poll for the result. \nFor example, the following code shows how you might poll for whether the vehicle is ready to arm (health_all_ok()).\n// Check if vehicle is ready to arm\nwhile (!telemetry->health_all_ok()) {\n    std::cout \nSimilarly, you can use the asynchronous method and block \n{\n    std::cout >();\n    auto future_result = prom->get_future();\n    telemetry->health_all_ok_async(\n    [prom](bool result) {\n        //fulfill promise if health is OK\n        if (result) {// health OK\n            prom->set_value();\n        }\n    });\n\n    future_result.get(); //Block until promise is fulfilled.\n    // Now ready to arm\n}\n\nDepending on the architecture of your application, you may even wish to arm the vehicle in your callback function. \nUsually though it is easier to understand program flow using the approach above.\nFurther Information\nAdditional information/examples for the Telemetry API are linked below:\n\nSDK Examples\nIntegration tests:\ntelemetry_async.cpp\ntelemetry_health.cpp\ntelemetry_modes.cpp\ntelemetry_simple.cpp\n\n\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

If a takeoff command is accepted the vehicle will change to the Takeoff mode, fly to the takeoff altitude, and then hover (in takeoff mode) until another instruction is received. \n\n PX4/SDK also provides other ways to take off:\n\nA copter or VTOL will take off automatically if a mission is started (fixed-wing will not). \nYou can also take off by manually driving the vehicle using the offboard API. \n\n\nThe vehicle will only take off once armed, and can only arm once it is \"healthy\" (has been calibrated, the home position has been set, and there is a high-enough quality GPS lock). After it starts flying, code needs to check that takeoff is complete before sending additional instructions.\nHealth Check\nThe code fragment below shows very simple code to synchronously poll for health status (using Telemetry:health_all_ok()) prior to arming:\n// Wait until health is OK and vehicle is ready to arm\nwhile (telemetry->health_all_ok() != true) {\n    std::cout \nThe code fragment below performs the same task, but additionally exits the app if calibration is required reports what conditions are still required before the vehicle is \"healthy\":\n// Exit if calibration is required\nTelemetry::Health check_health = telemetry->health();\nbool calibration_required = false;\nif (!check_health.gyrometer_calibration_ok) {\n    std::cout health_all_ok() != true) {\n    std::cout health();\n    if (!current_health.global_position_ok) {\n        std::cout \n\n Vehicle health can also be checked using Telemetry:health_all_ok_async(). \n\nArming\nOnce the vehicle is ready, use the following synchronous code to arm:\n// Arm vehicle\nstd::cout arm();\n\nif (arm_result != Action::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    std::cout \n\n If the arm() method returns Action::Result::SUCCESS then the vehicle is armed and can proceed to takeoff.

This target can be changed at any point before takeoff using set_takeoff_altitude(). The code fragment below shows how to set the takeoff altitude to 3 metres:\naction->set_takeoff_altitude(3.0);\n\nTakeoff Action\nOnce the vehicle is armed it can be commanded to take off. \nThe code below uses the synchronous takeoff() method, and fails if the vehicle refuses the command:\n// Command Take off\nstd::cout takeoff();\nif (takeoff_result != Action::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    std::cout \nIf the command succeeds the vehicle will takeoff, and hover at the takeoff altitude. Code should wait until takeoff has completed before sending the next instruction. Unfortunately there is no specific indicator to inform code that takeoff is complete. \n\n One alternative is to simply wait for enough time that the vehicle should have reached the takeoff altitude.\n\nThe code below checks for takeoff completion by polling the current altitude until the target altitude is reached:\nfloat target_alt=action->get_takeoff_altitude_m();\nfloat current_position=0;\nwhile (current_positionposition().relative_altitude_m;\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n}\n// Reached target altitude - continue with next instruction.\n\nLanding\nThe best way to land the vehicle at the current location is to use the land() or land_async() methods. If the command is accepted the vehicle will change to the Land mode and land at the current point. \n\n The SDK does not at time of writing recommend other approaches for landing: land mission items are not supported and manually landing the vehicle using the offboard is not as safe. \n\nThe code below shows how to use the land action.\nconst Action::Result land_result = action->land();\nif (land_result != Action::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    //Land failed, so exit (in reality might try a return to land or kill.)\n    return 1;\n}\n\nThe vehicle should land and then automatically disarm. If you want to monitor the landing you can trigger completion of the\napp based on the armed state, as shown below.\nwhile (telemetry->armed()) {\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\n}\nstd::cout \nReturn/RTL\nReturn mode (also known as \"Return to Launch\", \"Return to Land\", \"Return to Home\") flies the vehicle back to the home position and may also land the vehicle (depending on vehicle configuration). \nThis mode is invoked from Action using the return_to_launch() or return_to_launch_async() methods. \nThe code below shows how to use the synchronous method:\nconst Action::Result rtl_result = telemetry->return_to_launch();\nif (rtl_result != Action::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    //RTL failed, so exit (in reality might send kill command.)\n    return 1;\n}\n\nDepending on the vehicle it may land or hover around the return point. For vehicles that are configured to land you can use the same code as in the previous section to determine when the vehicle has disarmed.\nDisarm/Kill\nUse the disarm or kill methods to stop the drone motors (the difference is that disarming will only succeed if the drone considers itself landed, while kill will disarm a vehicle even in flight).\nThe methods are listed below. These are used in the same way as other similar Action APIs:\n\ndisarm(), disarm_async\nkill(), kill_async\n\n\n PX4 will automatically disarm the vehicle after landing. The disarm methods explicitly invoke the same functionality.\n\nGet/Set Cruise Speed\nYou can get/set the normal horizontal velocity used in Return mode, Hold mode, Takeoff (and other AUTO Flight Modes using the following methods:\n\nset_max_speed()\nget_max_speed_m_s\n\n\n These methods get/set the MPC_XY_CRUISE parameter. \n  They are used in the same way as the other Action methods.\n\nSwitch Between VTOL Modes \nAction provides methods to transition between VTOL fixed wing and multicopter modes, with both synchronous and asynchronous versions:\n\ntransition_to_fixedwing(), transition_to_multicopter()\ntransition_to_fixedwing_async(), transition_to_multicopter_async()\n\nThe associated action will only be executed for VTOL vehicles (on other vehicle types the command will fail with a Result of VTOL_TRANSITION_SUPPORT_UNKNOWN or NO_VTOL_TRANSITION_SUPPORT). \nThe command will succeed if called when the vehicle is already in the mode.\nThe code fragment below shows how to call the synchronous action to transition to fixed wing, \nand to print the result of the call (the other synchronous method is used in the same way). \nconst Action::Result fw_result = action->transition_to_fixedwing();\n\nif (fw_result != Action::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    std::cout \nFurther Information\nAdditional information/examples for the Action API are linked below:\n\nExample: Takeoff and Land\nExample: VTOL Transitions\nIntegration tests:\nsimple_hover.cpp\nasync_hover.cpp\ntakeoff_and_kill.cpp\ntransition_multicopter_fixedwing.cpp\n\n\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

allows you to create, upload, download, import from QGroundControl, run, pause, restart, jump to item in, and track missions. \nMissions can have multiple \"mission items\", each which may specify a position, altitude, fly-through behaviour, camera action, gimbal position, and the speed to use when traveling to the next position.\nMissions are managed though the Mission class, which communicates with the vehicle to upload mission information and run, pause, track the mission progress etc. \nThe mission that is uploaded to the vehicle is defined as a vector of MissionItem objects.\nSupported Mission Commands \nThe MissionItem class abstracts a small but useful subset of the mission commands supported by PX4 (and the MAVLink specification):\nThe supported set is:\n\nMAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT\nMAV_CMD_DO_CHANGE_SPEED\nMAV_CMD_DO_MOUNT_CONTROL\nMAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE\nMAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE\nMAV_CMD_VIDEO_START_CAPTURE\nMAV_CMD_VIDEO_STOP_CAPTURE\nMAV_CMD_NAV_LOITER_TIME\n\nAdditionally, the following commands are supported only for mission import/download (there are no corresponding MissionItem methods):\n\nMAV_CMD_NAV_LAND\nMAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF\n\n\n The Mission API does not (at time of writing) provide explicit functionality to \"repeat\", takeoff, return to land etc. \nThe SDK provides some omitted functionality through the Action API.\n\nCreate the Plugin\n\n Mission objects are created in the same way as other MAVSDK plugins.\n  General instructions are provided in the topic: Using Plugins.\n\nThe main steps are:\n\nLink the plugin library into your application. \nDo this by adding mavsdk_mission to the target_link_libraries section of the app's cmake build definition file\ntarget_link_libraries(your_application_name\n  mavsdk\n  ...\n  mavsdk_mission\n  ...\n)\n\n\nCreate a connection to a system. \nFor example (basic code without error checking):#include \nMavsdk dc;\nConnectionResult conn_result = dc.add_udp_connection();\n// Wait for the system to connect via heartbeat\nwhile (!dc.is_connected()) {\n   sleep_for(seconds(1));\n}\n// System got discovered.\nSystem &system = dc.system();\n\nCreate a shared pointer to an instance of Mission instantiated with the system: #include \nauto mission = std::make_shared(system);\n\n\nThe mission pointer can then used to access the plugin API (as shown in the following sections).\nDefining a Mission\nA mission must be defined as a vector of MissionItem objects as shown below:\nstd::vector> mission_items;\n\nYou can create as many MissionItem objects as you like and use std_vector::push_back() to add them to the back of the mission item vector. \nThe example below shows how to create and add a MissionItem, that just sets the target position (using set_position()). \n// Create MissionItem and set its position\nstd::shared_ptr new_item(new MissionItem());\nnew_item->set_position(47.40 /*latitude_deg*/, 8.5455360114574432 /*longitude_deg*/);\n\n// Add new_item to the vector\nmission_items.push_back(new_item);\n\nThe example below shows how you might set the other options on a second MissionItem (and add it to the mission).\nstd::shared_ptr new_item2(new MissionItem());\nnew_item2->set_position(47.50 /*latitude_deg*/, 8.5455360114574432 /*longitude_deg*/);\nnew_item2->set_relative_altitude(2.0f);\nnew_item2->set_speed(5.0f /* m/s */);\nnew_item2->set_fly_through(true);\nnew_item2->set_gimbal_pitch_and_yaw(20.0f /*pitch*/, 60.0f /*yaw degrees*/);\nnew_item2->set_camera_action(MissionItem::CameraAction::TAKE_PHOTO);\n\n//Add new_item2 to the vector\nmission_items.push_back(new_item2);\n\n\n The autopilot has sensible default values for the attributes. \n  If you do set a value (e.g. the desired speed) then it will be the default for the remainder of the mission.\n\n\n\n There are also getter methods for querying the current value of MissionItem attributes. \n  The default values of most fields are NaN (which means they are ignored/not sent).\n\nThe mission (mission_items) can then be uploaded as shown in the section Uploading a Mission below.\nConvenience Function\nThe Fly Mission uses a convenience function to create MissionItem objects. \nUsing this approach you have to specify every attribute for every mission item, whether or not the value is actually used.\nThe definition and use of this function is shown below:\nstd::shared_ptr make_mission_item(double latitude_deg,\n                                               double longitude_deg,\n                                               float relative_altitude_m,\n                                               float speed_m_s,\n                                               bool is_fly_through,\n                                               float gimbal_pitch_deg,\n                                               float gimbal_yaw_deg,\n                                               MissionItem::CameraAction camera_action)\n{\n    std::shared_ptr new_item(new MissionItem());\n    new_item->set_position(latitude_deg, longitude_deg);\n    new_item->set_relative_altitude(relative_altitude_m);\n    new_item->set_speed(speed_m_s);\n    new_item->set_fly_through(is_fly_through);\n    new_item->set_gimbal_pitch_and_yaw(gimbal_pitch_deg, gimbal_yaw_deg);\n    new_item->set_camera_action(camera_action);\n    return new_item;\n}\n\n\nmission_items.push_back(\n    make_mission_item(47.398170327054473,\n                      8.5456490218639658,\n                      10.0f, 5.0f, false,\n                      20.0f, 60.0f,\n                      MissionItem::CameraAction::NONE));\n\nImport a Mission from a QGC Plan \nMission allows you to import a mission from a QGroundControl plan (the imported mission can then be uploaded to a vehicle).\n\n To export a mission plan from the QGroundControl use the Sync Tool (Plan View > Sync Tool, and then select Save to File).\n\nThe mission is imported using the static import_qgroundcontrol_mission method. \nThe method will fail with an error if the plan file cannot be found, cannot be parsed, or if it contains mission items that are not supported.\nThe code fragment below shows how to import mission items from a plan:\nstd::string qgc_plan = \"file_path_to_some_qgroundcontrol.plan\"\nMission::mission_items_t mission_items;\nMission::Result import_res = Mission::import_qgroundcontrol_mission(mission_items, qgc_plan);\n\n\n Example:Fly QGC Plan Mission provides a working example with error checking.\n\nThe mission (mission_items) can then be uploaded as shown in the section Uploading a Mission below.\nUploading a Mission \nUse Mission::upload_mission_async() to upload the mission defined in the previous section.\nThe example below shows how this is done, using promises to wait on the result.\n// ... declare and populate the mission vector: mission_items\n\n{\n    auto prom = std::make_shared>();\n    auto future_result = prom->get_future();\n    mission->upload_mission_async(\n    mission_items, [prom](Mission::Result result) {\n        prom->set_value(result);\n    });\n\n    const Mission::Result result = future_result.get();\n    if (result != Mission::Result::SUCCESS) {\n        std::cout \nStarting/Pausing Missions\nStart or resume a paused mission using Mission::start_mission_async(). \nThe vehicle must already have a mission (the mission need not have been uploaded using the SDK).\nThe code fragment below shows how this is done, using promises to wait on the result.\n{\n    auto prom = std::make_shared>();\n    auto future_result = prom->get_future();\n    mission->start_mission_async(\n    [prom](Mission::Result result) {\n        prom->set_value(result);\n    });\n\n    const Mission::Result result = future_result.get(); //Wait on result\n    if (result != Mission::Result::SUCCESS) {\n        std::cout \nTo pause a mission use Mission::pause_mission_async(). \nThe code is almost exactly the same as for starting a mission:\n{\n    auto prom = std::make_shared>();\n    auto future_result = prom->get_future();\n\n    std::cout pause_mission_async(\n    [prom](Mission::Result result) {\n        prom->set_value(result);\n    });\n\n    const Mission::Result result = future_result.get();\n    if (result != Mission::Result::SUCCESS) {\n        std::cout \nMonitoring Progress\nAsynchronously monitor progress using Mission::subscribe_progress(), \nwhich receives a regular callback with the current MissionItem number and the total number of items.\nThe code fragment just takes a lambda function that reports the current status. \nmission->subscribe_progress( [](int current, int total) {\n       std::cout \n\n The mission is complete when current == total.\n\nThe following synchronous methods are also available for checking mission progress:\n\nmission_finished() - Checks if mission has been finished.\ncurrent_mission_item() - Returns the current mission item index.\ntotal_mission_items() - Gets the total number of items.\n\n\n The mission is (also) complete when current_mission_item() == total_mission_items().\n\nTaking Off, Landing, Returning\nIf using a copter or VTOL vehicle then PX4 will automatically takeoff when it is armed and a mission is started (even without a takeoff mission item). \nFor Fixed Wing vehicles the vehicle must be launched before starting a mission.\nAt time of writing the Mission API does not provide takeoff, land or \"return to launch\" MissionItems. \nIf required you can instead use the appropriate commands in the Action class.\n\nDownloading Missions\nUse Mission::download_mission_async() to download a mission from the vehicle. \nThe mission is downloaded as a vector of MissionItem objects, that you can then view or manipulate as required.\n\n Mission download will fail if the mission contains a command that is outside the supported set. \nMissions created using QGroundControl are not guaranteed to successfully download! \n\nThe code fragment below shows how to download a mission:\n{\n    std::cout > mission_items;\n    };\n\n    auto prom = std::make_shared>();\n    auto future = prom->get_future();\n\n    mission->download_mission_async(\n        [prom](Mission::Result result, std::vector> mission_items_downloaded) {\n            PromiseResult promise_result {};\n            promise_result.mission_result = result;\n            promise_result.mission_items = mission_items_downloaded;\n            prom->set_value(promise_result);\n    });\n\n    PromiseResult promise_result = future.get();\n\n    if (promise_result.mission_result != Mission::Result::SUCCESS) {\n        std::cout \nFurther Information\n\nMission Flight Mode (PX4 User Guide)\nExample:Fly

If viewed from above, the vehicle will turn clockwise if the value is positive and anticlockwise if it is negative. \nCalling set_velocity_body() using an initialiser list type declaration the final (fourth) value is the yaw rate/direction.\nExamples:\n\nTurn clock-wise at 60 degrees per second:offboard->set_velocity_body({0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 60.0f});\n\n\nTurn anti clock-wise at 5 degrees per second:offboard->set_velocity_body({0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, -5.0f});\n\n\n\nFly Forwards\nUse set_velocity_body() to set the velocity components relative to the body frame.\nTo fly forwards, simply set the first parameter (Offboard::VelocityBodyYawspeed::forward_m_s) when the vehicle is not rotating.\noffboard->set_velocity_body({5.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f});\n\nFly a Circle\nTo fly a circle, use set_velocity_body() with both forward and rotational components.\nThis will force the vehicle to travel in a curved path.\noffboard->set_velocity_body({5.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 30.0f});\n\nYou can force the vehicle to fly sideways by using the (Offboard::VelocityBodyYawspeed::right_m_s value), and in the other direction by using a negative rotation value:\n// Fly a circle sideways\noffboard->set_velocity_body({0.0f, -5.0f, 0.0f, -30.0f});\n\nPosition/Thrust Setpoints\nThe SDK does not support position or thrust setpoints (at time of writing).\nWaiting on Setpoints\nThe vehicle will obey the last setpoint called (when you call a setpoint the last one is cleared). \nThe SDK examples use timers to separate commands (e.g. sleep_for(seconds(8))) but in a real-world use case you might use telemetry or sensors to control when the setpoint is changed.\nMonitoring Offboard Mode\nThe vehicle may change out of offboard mode outside the control of your application (for example if a GCS were to put the vehicle into Hold mode).\nIn this case, the SDK will automatically stop sending setpoints and Offboard::is_active() will change from true to false.\nCalls to change the setpoint do not return an error! \nDepending on the particular use case, offboard code may need to explicitly monitor for flight mode and change behaviour appropriately (e.g. using Telemetry::flight_mode_async()).\nFurther Information\nAdditional information/examples for the Offboard API are linked below:\n\nExample: Offboard Velocity\nIntegration tests:\noffboard_velocity.cpp\n\n\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

The location APIs for supported platforms are listed below:\n\nAndroid: Location\nApple: Core Location Framework\nWindows: Windows.Devices.Geolocation\n\n\n Running QGroundControl at the same time as the SDK Follow Me may result in unpredictable behaviour as both send position updates. \nYou must ensure that GSC Position Streaming is disabled. \nUse the latest QGC Daily Build and ensure that the Application Setting > General > Miscellaneous > Stream GCS Position is set to Never.\n\nCreate the Plugin\n\n FollowMe objects are created in the same way as other SDK plugins.\n  General instructions are provided in the topic: Using Plugins.\n\nThe main steps are:\n\nLink the plugin library into your application. \nDo this by adding mavsdk_follow_me to the target_link_libraries section of the app's cmake build definition file\ntarget_link_libraries(your_application_name\n  mavsdk\n  ...\n  mavsdk_follow_me\n  ...\n)\n\n\nCreate a connection to a system. \nFor example (basic code without error checking):#include \nMavsdk dc;\nConnectionResult conn_result = dc.add_udp_connection();\n// Wait for the system to connect via heartbeat\nwhile (!dc.is_connected()) {\n   sleep_for(seconds(1));\n}\n// System got discovered.\nSystem &system = dc.system();\n\nCreate a shared pointer to an instance of FollowMe instantiated with the system: #include \nauto follow_me = std::make_shared(system);\n\n\nThe follow_me pointer can then used to access the plugin API (as shown in the following sections).\nSet the Follow Configuration\nBy default the vehicle will follow directly behind the target at a height and distance of 8 metres. \nYou can (optionally) call set_config() at any time to specify a different height, follow distance, relative position (front left/right/centre or behind) and responsiveness to target movements. \nThe code fragment below shows how to set the configuration:\n// configure follow me behaviour\nFollowMe::Config config;\nconfig.min_height_m = 12.f;  // Minimum height\nconfig.follow_distance_m = 20.f;  // Follow distance\nconfig.responsiveness = 0.2f;  // Higher responsiveness\nconfig.follow_direction = FollowMe::Config::FollowDirection::FRONT;  //Follow from front-centre\n\n// Apply configuration\nFollowMe::Result config_result = follow_me->set_config(config);\nif (config_result != FollowMe::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    // handle config-setting failure (in this case print error)\n    std::cout \nThe get_config() method is provided to get the current configuration:\nauto curr_config = follow_me->get_config();\n\nFollowing a Target\nTo start and stop following a target, call start() and stop(), respectively - start() puts the vehicle into Follow-Me mode and stop() puts it into Hold mode.\nUse set_target_location() to set the target position(s) for the vehicle to follow (the app typically passes its host's current position, which it would obtain using OS-specific methods). \nThis can be called at any time, but messages will only be sent once following is started. \nThe plugin automatically resends the last set position at the rate required by the autopilot/flight mode (1 Hz). \n\n Typically you would call set_target_location() before or shortly after starting the mode. If you call start() without having set any target location, or if the connection is broken, the vehicle will climb to minimum altitude (if needed) and remain in the mode waiting for messages. \n\n// Start following\nFollowMe::Result follow_me_result = follow_me->start();\nif (follow_me_result != FollowMe::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    // handle start failure (in this case print error)\n    std::cout set_target_location({ 47.39776569, 8.54553292, 0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 0.f });\n\n\n// Stop following\nfollow_me_result = follow_me->stop();\nif (follow_me_result != FollowMe::Result::SUCCESS) {\n    // handle stop failure (in this case print error)\n    std::cout \nThe last location that was set can be retrieved using get_last_location(). \nBefore a target position is first set this API will return Nan.\nFurther Information\nAdditional information/examples for the Follow Me API are linked below:\n\nExample:Follow Me Mode\nIntegration tests:\nfollow_me.cpp\n\n\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

Therefore, applications using the library need to be C++11 or later as well.\nApplications can be built using your preferred build system, compiler and linker toolchain. The only requirement is that the build system must be able to locate the SDK C++ headers and libraries (installed as described here).\nThe SDK itself uses the cmake build system, and we recommend that you do too.\nCMake is an open-source, cross-platform toolchain that allows you to build your examples on macOS, Linux and Windows using the same build file definition.\nBelow we explain how to set up a minimal build setup (CMakeLists.txt) file for your application.\nBuild Definition File - CMakeLists.txt\nCmake uses a definition file named CMakeLists.txt to define the project. This specifies the name of the project, compiler flags for different platforms and targets, where to find dependencies (libraries and header files), source files to build, and the name of the generated binary. CMakeLists.txt is typically stored in the root directory of your app project.\nThe sections below show how you can set up the file for when the SDK is installed system wide (the default) or locally.\n\n SDK system-wide installation is not supported on Windows (see #155).\n Instead build the app using a local SDK installation.\n Windows gurus, we'd love your help to implement this).\n\nSDK Installed System-wide \nA \"template\" CMakeLists.txt is shown below.\nMost of file is boilerplate - the main things you need to change are your_project_name, your_executable_name and your_source_file. You should also make sure that any plugins used by your app are listed in the target_link_libraries section.\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)\n\n# Specify your project's name\nproject(your_project_name)\n\n# Specify at least C++11\nadd_definitions(\"-std=c++11\")\n\n# Enable strict handling of warnings\nadd_definitions(\"-Wall -Wextra -Werror\")\n\n# In case /usr/local/include is not in your default includes\n#include_directories(/usr/local/include)\n\n# In case /usr/local/lib is not in your default linker path\n#link_directories(/usr/local/lib)\n\n# Specify your app's executable name, and list of source files used to create it.\nadd_executable(your_executable_name\n    your_source_file.cpp\n    # ... any other source files\n)\n\n# Specify your app's executable name and a list of linked libraries\ntarget_link_libraries(your_executable_name\n    mavsdk          #All apps link against mavsdk library\n    mavsdk_action      # If action plugin used by app ...\n    mavsdk_telemetry   #If telemetry plugin used by app ...\n    # ... Any other linked libraries\n)\n\n\n The file format and required modifications are self-explanatory.\nIf additional information is required see the cmake documentation.\n\nSDK Installed Locally \n\n Where possible install the SDK system wide and follow the instructions in the previous section.\nYou will need to install locally on Windows.\n\nCMakeLists.txt is more complicated when the SDK is installed locally,\nbecause you need to specify where the build should find both headers and library files relative to your current directory.\nYou have to change the same information as before: your_project_name, your_executable_name and your_source_file.\n\n The example file below assumes that the SDK was installed locally into the directory **MAVSDK/build/default/install/ and that the application is at the same level as the SDK as described in the tree below:\n .\n ├── MAVSDK\n │   ├── build\n │   │   └── default\n │   │       └── install\n │   │           ├──include\n │   │           │   └── mavsdk\n │   │           │       ├── mavsdk.h\n │   │           │       └── ..\n │   │           └── lib\n │   │               ├── libmavsdk.so\n │   │               ├── libmavsdk_action.so\n │   │               └── ...\n │   │\n │   └── CMakeLists.txt\n └── my_app\n     ├── CMakeLists.txt\n     └── fly_mission.cpp\n\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)\n\n## Specify your project's name\nproject(your_project_name)\n\n# Specify at least C++11\nadd_definitions(\"-std=c++11\")\n\n# Enable strict handling of warnings\nif(NOT MSVC)\n    add_definitions(\"-Wall -Wextra -Werror\")\nelse()\n    # Different flags for Microsoft Visual Studio\n    add_definitions(\"-WX -W2\")\nendif()\n\n# Specify include directories\ninclude_directories(\n    ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../../install/include\n)\n\n# Specify your app's executable name, and list of source files used to create it.\nadd_executable(your_executable_name\n    your_source_file.cpp\n    # ... any other source files\n)\n\n# Specify your app's executable name and a list of linked libraries\ntarget_link_libraries(your_executable_name\n    mavsdk\n    mavsdk_action\n    mavsdk_telemetry\n    # ... any other linked libraries\n)\n\nBuilding the App\nThis section assumes that you have already built and installed the SDK C++ Library and that your example has a CMakeLists.txt in its root directory.\nLinux/macOS\nTo create and run the app on Linux/macOS:\n\nFirst create a build directory and run cmake:cd /path/to/your/application/   # Open a prompt and navigate to your application\nmkdir build && cd build   # Create a build directory and navigate into it\ncmake ..   # Create make files for your current platform\n\n\n Make files for release binaries are created by default.

For Linux this is done as shown below:sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev\n\n\nTo use QGroundControl with this example you must ensure that GSC Position Streaming is disabled (otherwise QGC and the SDK will both send position updates and they will conflict). \nTo do this use the latest QGC Daily Build and ensure that the Application Setting > General > Miscellaneous > Stream GCS Position is set to Never.\n\nOtherwise the example is built and run in the normal way (as described here). \nThe example terminal output should be similar to that shown below:\n\n This is from a debug build of the SDK. \n  A release build will omit the \"Debug\" messages.\n\n$ ./follow_me udp://:14540\n[01:55:59|Info ] DronecodeSDK version: 0.2.8 (dronecode_sdk_impl.cpp:25)\nWait for system to connect via heartbeat\n[01:55:59|Info ] New device on: 127.0.0.1:14580 (udp_connection.cpp:200)\n[01:55:59|Debug] New: System ID: 1 Comp ID: 1 (dronecode_sdk_impl.cpp:286)\n[01:55:59|Debug] Component Autopilot added.

You can also install files locally/relative to the MAVSDK tree if needed.\n\n System-wide installation is not yet supported on Windows (see #155) so you will need to install the SDK locally.\nWindows gurus, we'd love your help to implement this).\n\nSystem-wide Install \nSystem-wide installation copies the SDK headers and binaries to the standard system-wide locations for your platform (e.g. on Ubuntu Linux this is /usr/local/).\n\n System-wide installation overwrites any previously installed version of the SDK.\n\nTo install the SDK system-wide:\nsudo cmake --build build/default --target install # sudo is required to install to system directories!\n\n# First installation only\nsudo ldconfig  # update linker cache\n\n\n The first time you build the SDK you may also need to update the linker cache.\n  On Ubuntu this is done with sudo ldconfig, as shown above.\n\nLocal Install \nLocal installation copies the SDK headers/library to a user-specified location inside the SDK source directory.\nOn Linux/macOS use the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable to specify a path relative to the folder from which you call cmake\n(or an absolute path).\nFor example, to install into the MAVSDK/install/ folder you would call:\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -Bbuild/default -H.\ncmake --build build/default --target install\n\n\n If you already have run cmake without setting CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, you may need to clean the build first:\n  rm -rf build/default\n\n\nBuild for Android \nBuild for Android using the dockcross cross compiler, as described in the cross-compilation section below (e.g. with the dockcross/android-arm64 image).\nBuild for iOS \nTo build for real iOS devices on macOS:\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=tools/ios.toolchain.cmake -DPLATFORM=OS -Bbuild/ios -H.\ncmake --build build/ios\n\nBuild for the iOS simulator on macOS:\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=tools/ios.toolchain.cmake -DPLATFORM=SIMULATOR64 -Bbuild/ios_simulator -H.\n\n\n The commands above build the mavsdk_server (-DBUILD_BACKEND=ON).\n  This is required for contributors who want to extend the MAVSDK programming-language-specific libraries like MAVSDK-Swift, but is not required for developers who just want to use C++, MAVSDK-Swift or MAVSDK-Python.\n\nBuild SDK Extensions \nThe MAVSDK can be extended with plugins and integration tests that are defined \"out of tree\".\nThese are declared inside a parallel directory that is included into the SDK at compile time (by specifying EXTERNAL_DIR in the make command).\nThe commands to build the SDK with an extension library are:\ncmake -DEXTERNAL_DIR=relative_path_to_external_directory -Dbuild/default -H.\ncmake --build build/default\n\nSee SDK Extensions for more information.\nBuilding mavsdk_server \nThe MAVSDK programming-language-specific libraries (e.g. Swift, Python) share a common backend (called \"mavsdk_server\").\nThis may optionally be built as part of the C++ library.\nThe cmake configuration step additionally depends on the -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON option.\nOtherwise the build is exactly the same as usual.\n\n When building mavsdk_server, we usually like to link all the dependencies statically, and therefore we set -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF (or don't specify it, because the default is OFF).\n\nUbuntu \nTo build mavsdk_server on Ubuntu:\n\nSetup the C++ Library on Linux\nNavigate into the SDK directory and build the projectcd MAVSDK\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -Bbuild/default -H.\ncmake --build build/default\n\n\nmacOS \nTo build mavsdk_server on macOS:\n\nSetup the C++ Library on macOS\nNavigate into the SDK directory and build the projectcd MAVSDK\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -Bbuild/default -H.\ncmake --build build/default\n\n\nWindows \nTo build mavsdk_server on Windows:\n\nSetup the C++ Library on Windows\nNavigate into the SDK directory and build the projectcmake -G \"Visual Studio 15 2017\" -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -Bbuild/default -H.\ncmake --build build/default\n\n\nCross compilation using dockcross \nCross compilation is usually the fastest way to compile for \"embedded\" platforms like the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Blue or Nvidia Jetson (i.e. typically faster than native compilation on device itself).\nWe recommend using dockcross, which is a very convenient tool for cross compilation based on docker (and which supports many platforms).\nFor example, use the commands below to build for armv7:\n\nMake sure docker is installed on your system.\nNavigate into the SDK directory, and use the commands below:cd MAVSDK\ndocker run --rm dockcross/linux-armv7 > ./dockcross-linux-armv7\nchmod +x ./dockcross-linux-armv7\n./dockcross-linux-armv7 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_BACKEND=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -Bbuild/linux-armv7 -S.\n./dockcross-linux-armv7 cmake --build build/linux-armv7 -j 8\n\nIf all goes well, mavsdk_server is built. You can check the file with:./dockcross-linux-armv7 file build/linux-armv7-release/src/backend/src/mavsdk_server\nbuild/linux-armv7-release/src/backend/src/mavsdk_server: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3, for GNU/Linux 4.10.8, not stripped\n\nThe newly built binary can now be copied to the device:cp build/linux-armv7/src/backend/src/mavsdk_server somewhere/else\n\n\n\n The commands above build the mavsdk_server (-DBUILD_BACKEND=ON).\n  This is required for contributors who want to extend the MAVSDK programming-language-specific libraries like MAVSDK-Swift.\n  It is not required for developers who just want to use C++, MAVSDK-Swift or MAVSDK-Python.\n\nBuild API Reference Documentation \nThe C++ source code is annotated using comments using Doxygen syntax.\nExtract the documentation to markdown files (one per class) on macOS or Linux using the commands:\nrm -rf tools/docs # Remove previous docs\n./tools/generate_docs.sh\n\nThe files are created in /install/docs/markdown.\n\n Extracting the API reference does not yet work automatically on Windows.\n\n\n\n The generate_docs.sh script builds the library, installs it locally to /install, and then uses DOxygen to create XML documentation in /install/docs/xml.\nThe generate_markdown_from_doxygen_xml.py script\nis then run on all files in the /xml directory to generate markdown files in /install/docs/markdown.\n\nTroubleshooting\nThe vast majority of common build issues can be resolved by updating submodules and cleaning the distribution:\ncd MAVSDK\ngit submodule update --recursive\nrm -rf build\nThen attempt to build again.\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

These should be used for setting up and cleaning everything that depends on having the System instantiated. This includes calls that set up callbacks.\nenable()/disable(): These are called when a vehicle is discovered or has timed out. They should be used for managing resources needed to access a connected system/vehicle (e.g. getting a parameter or changing a setting).\n\nThe external example provides a minimal implementation.\nAdditional detail is provided for methods below.\ninit() \nvirtual void init() = 0\n\nThe init() method is called when a plugin is instantiated. \nThis happens when a System is constructed (this does not mean that the system actually exists and is connected - it might just be an empty dummy system).\nPlugins should do initialization steps with other parts of the SDK at this state, e.g. set up callbacks with _parent (DeviceImpl).\ndeinit() \nvirtual void deinit() = 0\n\nThe deinit() method is called before a plugin is destroyed. This usually happens only at the very end, when a MAVSDK instance is destroyed.\nPlugins should cleanup anything that was set up during init().\nenable() \nvirtual void enable() = 0\n\nThe enable() method is called when a system is discovered (connected). \nPlugins should do all initialization/configuration steps that require a system to be connected. \nFor example, setting/getting parameters.\nIf any threads, call_every or timeouts are needed, they can be started in this method.\ndisable() \nvirtual void disable() = 0\n\nThe disable() method is called when a system has timed out. \nThe method is also called before deinit() is called to stop any systems with active plugins from communicating (in order to prevent warnings and errors because communication to the system no longer works).\nIf any threads, call_every, or timeouts are running, they should be stopped in this method.\nTest Code \nTests must be created for all new and updated plugin code. \nThe tests should be exhaustive, and cover all aspects of using the plugin API.\nThe Google Test Primer\nprovides an excellent overview of how tests are written and used.\n\n Testing is the same for plugins in SDK and the SDK Extensions.\n\nWriting Unit Tests\nMost of the existing plugins do not have unit tests, \nbecause we do not yet have the ability to mock MAVLink communications (needed to test most plugins). \nUnit tests are therefore considered optional!\n\n Comprehensive integration tests should be written instead, with the simulator providing appropriate MAVLink messages.\n\nAdding Unit Tests \nUnit test files are stored in the same directory as their associated source code. \nOften they test the implementation (rather than the public API), \nand hence are named with the suffix _impl_test.cpp.\nIn order to include a test in the SDK unit test program (unit_tests_runner), \nit must be added to the UNIT_TEST_SOURCES variable in the plugin CMakeLists.txt file.\nFor example, to add the example_impl_test.cpp unit test you would \nappend the following lines to its CMakeLists.txt:\nlist(APPEND UNIT_TEST_SOURCES\n    ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/plugins/mission/example_impl_test.cpp\n)\nset(UNIT_TEST_SOURCES ${UNIT_TEST_SOURCES} PARENT_SCOPE)\n\nUnit Test Code\nUnit tests typically include the file to be tested, mavsdk.h, and gtest.h.\nThere are no standard shared test unit resources so test functions are declared using TEST. \nAll tests in a file should share the same test-case name (the first argument to TEST).\nThe skeleton example plugin unit test is shown below: \n#include \"example_impl.h\"\n#include \"mavsdk.h\"\n#include \"global_include.h\"\n#include \n\nnamespace mavsdk {\n\nTEST(ExampleImpl, NoTest)\n{\n    ASSERT_TRUE(true);\n}\n\n} // namespace mavsdk\n\nWriting Integration Tests \nThe SDK provides the integration_tests_runner application for running the integration tests and some helper code to make it easier to log tests and run them against the simulator.\n\n Check out the Google Test Primer \nand the integration_tests \nfor our existing plugins to better understand how to write your own!\n\nAdding Integration Tests\nIn order to run an integration test it needs to be added to the integration_tests_runner program.\nIntegration tests for core functionality and plugins delivered by the project \nare stored in MAVSDK/src/integration_tests.\nThe files are added to the test program in that folder's \nCMakeLists.txt file:\n# This includes all GTests that run integration tests\nadd_executable(integration_tests_runner\n    ../core/unittests_main.cpp\n    simple_connect.cpp\n    async_connect.cpp\n    telemetry_simple.cpp\n    ...\n    mission_change_speed.cpp\n    mission_survey.cpp\n    gimbal.cpp\n    transition_multicopter_fixedwing.cpp\n    follow_me.cpp\n)\n\nIntegration tests for SDK Extensions are handled in the exactly the same way: \nexternal_example       ## The (example) SDK/external plugin directory.\n├── integration_tests\n│   ├── CMakeLists.txt\n│   └── hello_world.cpp\nExample extension CMakeLists.txt file:\nadd_executable(external_example_integration_tests_runner\n    ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/core/unittests_main.cpp\n    hello_world.cpp\n)\n\nIntegration Test Files/Code\nThe main SDK-specific functionality is provided by integration_test_helper.h. \nThis provides access to the Plugin/Test Logger and a shared test class SitlTest for setting up and tearing down the PX4 simulator.\n\n All tests must be declared using TEST_F and have a first argument SitlTest as shown. \n  This is required in order to use the shared class to set up and tear down the simulator between tests.\n\nThe example integration test hello_world.cpp demonstrates this below. \n#include \n#include \n#include \"mavsdk.h\"\n#include \"plugins/example/example.h\"\n#include \"integration_test_helper.h\"\n\nusing namespace dronecode_sdk;\n\nTEST_F(SitlTest, ExampleHello)\n{\n    Mavsdk dc;\n\n    ConnectionResult ret = dc.add_udp_connection();\n    ASSERT_EQ(ret, ConnectionResult::SUCCESS);\n\n    // Wait for system to connect via heartbeat.\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));\n    ASSERT_TRUE(dc.is_connected());\n\n    System &system = dc.system();\n    auto example = std::make_shared(system);\n\n    // Apparently it can say hello.\n    example->say_hello();\n}\n\nExample Code\n\n It is quicker and easier to write and modify integration tests than examples. \nDo not write example code until the plugin has been accepted!\n\nA simple example should be written that demonstrates basic usage of its API by 3rd parties. \nThe example need not cover all functionality, but should demonstrate enough that developers can see how it is used and how the example might be extended.\nWhere possible examples should demonstrate realistic use cases such that the code can usefully be copied and reused by external developers.\nDocumentation\nIn-Source Comments\nThe public API must be fully documented using Doxygen markup.\nAll items should minimally have a brief description (preceded by the @brief tag).\n\n The in-source comments will be compiled to markdown and included in the API Reference.\nThe process is outlined in Documentation > API Reference.\n\nInternal/implementation classes need not be documented, but should be written so that their use can be inferred.\nExample Code Documentation\nThe plugin example should be documented in markdown following the same pattern as the existing examples. \nGenerally this involves explaining what the example does and displaying the source.\nThe explanation of how the code works is usually deferred to guide documentation.\nGuide Documentation \nIdeally, guide documentation should be created. This should be based on example code.\nThe purpose of the guide is to:\n\nShow how different parts of the API can be used together\nHighlight usage patterns and limitations that may not be obvious from API reference\nProvide code fragments that can easily be reused\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.

Start a discussion if you have suggestions for improvement (the project will consider anything other than \"matters of personal taste\").\n\nFormatting and White Space\nAll .cpp and .h files should be formatted according to the .clang-format style.\nTo automatically fix the formatting, run the command:\n./tools/fix_style.sh .\nGeneral Guidelines\nThe following general guidelines should be used for all code:\n\nC++11 is encouraged to allow developers to use C++11 features and the standard library.Examples:\n\nstd::function and lambda expressions\nstd::vector, std::map\nstd::thread, std::mutex\n\n\nusing namespace std is discouraged (read why).If needed specific declarations can be used in the source files such as using std::this_thread::sleep_for to reduce verbosity.\n\nThe usage of namespacing wherever possible is encouraged (e.g. enum class is to be used over enum).\n\nFilename extensions should be .h for header files and .cpp for source files (for consistency).\nVariable and method names should err on the side of verbosity instead of being quick to type and read. Abbreviations are only to be used for small scopes and should not be exposed in public APIs.\nAll variables that have a physical unit should have the unit in the variable name (e.g. _m for meters, _m_s for meters/second).\nVariable and method names should be snake_case and class/struct/enum names CamelCase. Private variables should start with an underscore, e.g.: _variable_name.\nTry to exit functions early instead of nesting ifs (read why).\nWe don't use exceptions but use error codes. There are pros and cons for exceptions but given that the public API should be as simple as possible, it makes sense to refrain from exceptions altogether.\n\n  © Dronecode 2017-2019.
